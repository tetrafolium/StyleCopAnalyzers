## Cause

The keyword _protected_ is positioned after the keyword _internal_ within the declaration of a protected internal C# element, or the keyword _private_ is positioned after the keyword _protected_.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a protected internal element's access modifiers are written as _internal protected_, or when a private protected element's access modifiers are written as _protected private_. In reality, an element with the keywords _protected internal_ will have the same access level as an element with the keywords _internal protected_. To make the code easier to read and more consistent, StyleCop standardizes the ordering of these keywords, so that a protected internal element will always be described as such, and never as internal protected. This can help to reduce confusion about whether these access levels are indeed the same.

## How to fix violations

To fix an instance of this violation, place the _protected_ keyword before the _internal_ keyword, or place the _private_ keyword before the _protected_ keyword.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.OrderingRules", "SA1207:ProtectedMustComeBeforeInternal", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1207 // ProtectedMustComeBeforeInternal
#pragma warning restore SA1207 // ProtectedMustComeBeforeInternal
```
