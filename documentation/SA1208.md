## Cause

A using directive which declares a member of the _System_ namespace appears after a using directive which declares a member of a different namespace, within a C# code file.

## Rule description

A violation of this rule occurs when a using directive for the _System_ namespace is placed after a non-_System_ using directive. Placing all _System_ using directives at the top of the using directives can make the code cleaner and easier to read, and can help make it easier to identify the namespaces that are being used by the code.

## How to fix violations

To fix an instance of this violation, place the _System_ using directive above all using directives for other namespaces.

## How to suppress violations

```csharp
[SuppressMessage("StyleCop.CSharp.OrderingRules", "SA1208:SystemUsingDirectivesMustBePlacedBeforeOtherUsingDirectives", Justification = "Reviewed.")]
```

```csharp
#pragma warning disable SA1208 // SystemUsingDirectivesMustBePlacedBeforeOtherUsingDirectives
#pragma warning restore SA1208 // SystemUsingDirectivesMustBePlacedBeforeOtherUsingDirectives
```
